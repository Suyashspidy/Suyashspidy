üöÄ About Me

Hello, I'm Suyash Saxena, a Data Scientist, Data & Business Analyst, and passionate problem-solver with over 6 years of experience across Data Science, Business Intelligence, and Product Management. I specialize in turning raw data into actionable stories that drive strategy, enhance products, and empower decision-making. My expertise lies in solving complex business challenges with data-driven, analytical thinking, integrating creativity and innovation.

Currently, I'm a Senior Data Analyst at AC Transit, where I've led initiatives that reduced assault rates, collisions, and incidents, achieving a 15% improvement in safety metrics through advanced data analytics and visualization using Python, Tableau, Power BI, and Azure DevOps. I also collaborated on a computer vision-based online ticketing system, contributing over $5 million in revenue within six months.

I enjoy solving real-world problems with data and constantly learning new technologies.
